# golang-mongo-graphql-003

## Overview
This is meant to be a template/example for golang + gin + gqlgen (graphql) + dataloaderen + mongodb. This was built as a personal project for learning and "mastering" golang. Use this to your hearts desire.

## Getting Started

### Local Development
1. Ensure all go modules are installed by running ```$ go mod download```
2. Ensure all necessary local infrastructure is active by running ```$ ./scripts/infra/local/start``` - this ensures mongodb is up and running
3. ***Coming Soon*** (scripts to seed data into mongo)
4. Run server with ```$ go run server.go``` and visit http://localhost:8080/ for graphql playground
5. TODO: add additional steps - going to sleep for now :)
